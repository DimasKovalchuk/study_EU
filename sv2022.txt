HI my name is Dima, Im 31 years old. I love to work and improve my skills as phisyoli as mentali. I am married and I have 8 years old son.
Ins university I studyed psychology, however during my life I had different work experience.
Why I choose testing and QA I think that is an iteresting job which gives you an apportunity to know other activities and you as a QA will be responsible for the quality of product creation and it's release.
