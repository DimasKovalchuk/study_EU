HI my name is Dima, Im 31 years old. I love to work and improve my skills as phisyoli as mentali. I am married and I have 8 years old son.
Ins university I studyed psychology, however during my life I had different work experience.
Why I choose testing and QA I think that is an iteresting job which gives you an apportunity to know other activities and you as a QA will be responsible for the quality of product creation and it's release.
I find it very interesting to be involved in thr\e creation of something.
I used to do sport since childhood but when I get older it became  as Lifestyle.
For the last 6 years I helped people to be healthier by restoring their biomehanics movaments. This hobby became my proffecion.
I collected knoledges and skills all my life and I deeply appreciate all my trainers and teachers who tought mei.
But life is changing and I alwayse tried to find proffecion which gives you an apportunity to grow and freedom and this is very importnant because other proffecion are taking it from you.
I started to work since 17 years old. Iwork for ice-cream company as a sales manager. To sell an ice-cream at winter time it's an art.
After 4 years I took a decision to change something so I moved into construction . For the 5 years I even create my own bissines of supplying construction materials, but still I felt that was not about me, so i decieded to go out from my comfort zone and I went to Indonesia and for 2  years I was studying massage technies and physical rehabilitation.
The most difficult part for me to being active in social media. 5 times I've tried it but after I understood how nessesary it is, I found my own way and it's started to get better.
